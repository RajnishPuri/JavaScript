The g at the end means global, ie. that you want to search for all occurrences. Without it, you'll just get the first match.

\d, as you know, means a single digit. You can add quantifiers to specify whether you want to match all the following, or a certain amount of digits afterwards.

\d means a single digit

\d+ means all sequential digits

So let's say we have a string like this:

123 456
7890123
/\d/g will match [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3]

/\d/ will match 1

/\d+/ will match 123

/\d+/g will match [123,456,7890123]

You could also use /\d{1,3}/g to say you want to match all occurrences where there are from 1 to 3 digits in a sequence.

Another common quantifier is the star symbol, which means 0 or more. For example /1\d*/g would match all sequences of digits that start with 1, and have 0 or more digits after it.
